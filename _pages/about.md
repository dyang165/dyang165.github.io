Welcome to my personal page! I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California. I am a member of the [Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory](https://sail.usc.edu), advised by Professor [Shrikanth Narayanan](https://sail.usc.edu/people/shri.html). My work is suppported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 	

I am current interested in *multimodal transformers, vision-language modeling, and multimodal media understanding.* I believe there are is a lot to improve in how deep models process data from different modalities, and ultimately, wish to distill these ideas into inductive biases for AI models. 

Please feel free to reach out to me via any of my socials above if you are looking to collaborate!
